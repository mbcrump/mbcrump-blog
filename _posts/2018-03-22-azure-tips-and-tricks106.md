## Intro

Most folks aren't aware of how powerful the [Azure](http://www.azure.com) platform really is. As I've been presenting topics on Azure, I've had many people say, "How did you do that?" So I'll be documenting my tips and tricks for Azure in these posts.

## Introducing Azure Tips and Tricks Videos!

Several folks noticed that I didn't post Day 6 in my latest [end-to-end scenario series](http://www.michaelcrump.net/azure-tips-and-tricks101/) as regularly scheduled and wondered where I went. Well, for the past couple fo months, and especially days, behind the scenes I've been working with [Cecil Phillip](https://twitter.com/cecilphillip) on a new video format for Azure Tips and Tricks. We've officially launched our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi00MP5k2uxC3ZFxylwQtuA) and would encourage you to subscribe for future updates.
