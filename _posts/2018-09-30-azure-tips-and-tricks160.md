[Download it here](http://ebook.azuredev.tips)

I'm pleased to announce a new FREE eBook that I've been working on for the past couple of months that list the BEST of Azure Tips and Tricks of all-time.

When I reflect back on Azure Tips and Tricks a year ago, I was only thinking that I’d write a couple of posts and move on. Fast-forward to today, the collection has grown to over 150+ tips, as well as videos, conference talks, and now an eBook spanning the entire universe of the Azure platform. What you are currently reading is a special collection of tips based on page views of the entire series over the last year.

I’ve grouped the top tips and landed on four chapters: 

* Chapter 1: Web
* Chapter 2: Data
* Chapter 3: Serverless
* Chapter 4: Productivity

I took inspiration from the book called Code Complete that had the several illustrations such as Key Points and created myself in a pixelated form that is used throughout the book. Below is what they represent:

I hope you enjoy reading the eBook as much as I did writing it.
