title: "Azure Tips and Tricks Part 189 - Guided tour of Azure Machine Learning Studio"
excerpt: "If it makes the tool more approachable, you could think of Azure ML Studio as the low bar for machine learning that makes it easy for everyone to get into AI. I like to think of it more simply as a playroom where I do experiments with machine learning that no else needs to see."
